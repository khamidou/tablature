I'm not sure that this thing warrants its own repo but here it is:
tablature.el is a small emacs lisp script (four functions, actually)
which help editing tablatures in emacs.

Here is a quick reference:
- draw-tablature inserts an empty tablature template at the point
- insert-tab-column followed by a number of columns inserts this 
  number of columns at the point.
